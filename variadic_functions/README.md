Hello, this repository is the object of project 2 of this week november 2025

We will work on variadic functions and learn new concepts like va start, va list, va arg, and va end.

Thats will be useful to create our own printf function next week. 

And variadic functions are usefull to declare arguments that will dont know precisely their number.
